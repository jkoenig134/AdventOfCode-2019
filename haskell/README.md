# Haskell solution
This directory contains the solutions in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).

## Requirements
You need the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) to run the solutions.
If you want to go on working with Haskell I recommend the whole Haskell Platform.
You can download it [here](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

### Run it
I suggest to use `solve` in the root directory.
It executes `run <DayXX> <../input/DayXX.txt`.
To delete all compiled files, you can use `clean`.

## Contribution
As I am not very familiar with monads and IO functions I appreciate every enhancement.
Just open an issue with your concerns so we can discuss it.

## Conclusion
I tried to solve the challenges until day 15.
The first days were a lot of fun.
It was also nice to discuss possible strategies with other participants.

But after few days the challenges got harder and it took a lot of time to complete them.
In addition, two challenges (part 1 and 2) were to much for me.

So [AdventOfCode 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) was a lot of fun and it was a good feeling after completing a challenge after hours of trying.
Unfortunately my approach of "clean functional code" results in a "shit code compilation".

Nevertheless it's an awesome and instructive event!
See you next year.
